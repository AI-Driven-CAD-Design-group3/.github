# AI-Driven CAD Design, Group 3

We are a student project team exploring how modern AI tools can support engineering design work. Our focus is practical use cases around CAD workflows, documentation, and decision making.

## What we are exploring
- AI assisted engineering drawings and drafting support
- AI generated assembly instructions and build documentation
- Translating customer needs into measurable engineering requirements
- Design evaluation, optimization, and material reduction using AI assisted analysis
- CAD adjacent workflows such as CAM, CNC machining, and 3D print G code improvements

## How we work
We run weekly check ins, track tasks, and keep written notes so the project remains reproducible and easy to hand off. Our documentation is organized by week and by contributor.
